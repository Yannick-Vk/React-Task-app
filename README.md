# React ToDo

A minimal ToDo application built with React and React Router — a small project demonstrating task creation, listing, and
removal with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Technologies

- React (with TypeScript)
- React Router
- Vite for fast development and bundling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Node.js / npm (for local development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd React-ToDo

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the development server (HMR enabled):

   npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 by default when run with Vite.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

npm run build

## Notes

- If your environment uses a different package manager (pnpm, yarn, bun), adapt the install/run commands accordingly.
- The project uses TypeScript — run-time type checking is limited to compilation; use your editor's TypeScript tooling
  for best DX.
